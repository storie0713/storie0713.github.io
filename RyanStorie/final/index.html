        <h1>Concussions Over Time (2012–2014)</h1>

        <p>In the past two decades, few issues in sports have drawn as much concern and scientific inquiry as concussions. Once dismissed as “getting your bell rung,” concussions are now recognized as a form of mild traumatic brain injury with serious short- and long-term consequences. From 2012 to 2014, the National Football League alone recorded hundreds of concussions, underscoring the severity and frequency of head injuries at the sport’s highest level.</p>

        <p>Data from this period shows not only the prevalence of concussions but also the extensive time athletes missed from playing, measured in weeks and total snaps lost. Yet, the NFL represents just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath it lies a youth and high school sports culture where concussions are often underreported, misunderstood, or minimized, exposing countless young athletes to similar risks without the medical resources professional players receive.</p>

        <h3>Interview with Anne Rex, staff physician, Cleveland Clinic</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 0.9em;">Contact: 216-217-6441 | Source: Friend of parent | Interview: Phone call, 15 minutes</p>
        <p><em>"A lot of it has to be player awareness because, you know, kind of the only person that really knows how they're feeling is the player themselves."</em></p>

        <p>Between 2012 and 2014, concussions led to significant lost playing time across NFL teams. Injured players missed hundreds of weeks collectively, often being sidelined for one or more games. Some injuries resulted in extended absences or even career-ending consequences.</p>

        <iframe src="https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/storyline/latest/embed/index.html?dataURL=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2Fe%2F2PACX-1vT2UZzG3w_LIKTDPiqSwjUsMIteK3oLWYEz1ZokpO4JB2V5839_w9FjZ0TetDNov5kArwCgyrtvhBCO%2Fpubhtml&amp;dataYCol=value&amp;dataXCol=date&amp;dataDateFormat=%25Y-%25m-%25d&amp;chartDateFormat=%25Y-%25m-%25d&amp;chartYLabel=Weeks%20missed&amp;sliderCardTitleCol=annotationtitle&amp;sliderCardTextCol=annotationdescription"
          style="width:100%; height:650px;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

        <p>Some positions, particularly wide receivers, running backs, and defensive backs, accounted for a disproportionate share of concussion-related absences. Not only did individual players face downtime, but teams experienced a cumulative toll, with performance and season outcomes affected.</p>

        <p><em>"Education for the coaching staff to recognize when players are not acting appropriately after a hit — recognizing a hard hit, recognizing a slow to get up, stumble, shaking it off, or acting inappropriately."</em></p>

        <h3>Snaps Missed as a Result of Concussions</h3>
        <iframe title="Snaps missed as a result of concussions" aria-label="Bullet Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-yLTlO" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yLTlO/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;"></iframe>
        <script>
          window.addEventListener("message", function(e) {
            if(e.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
              document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-yLTlO").style.height = e.data["datawrapper-height"].yLTlO + "px";
            }
          });
        </script>

        <p>While professional athletes receive advanced care and follow strict return-to-play protocols, younger athletes often do not. Each year, up to 1.9 million U.S. youth experience sports-related concussions, many of them in football. Studies have shown that concussions make up roughly 9 to 13 percent of all athletic injuries at the high school level.</p>

        <p><em>"There is an added risk of enduring another concussion before a concussion is not fully healed."</em></p>

        <p>The implications of repeated concussions can be severe. Research into CTE, a degenerative brain disease linked to head trauma, has shown that even athletes who never reach the professional level may be at risk. In fact, a study found signs of CTE in 41 percent of young deceased athletes under the age of 30.</p>

        <p>The NFL has taken steps to address these risks, including improved helmet technology, rule changes, and stricter medical protocols. Independent neurological consultants now attend games to evaluate players showing signs of head injury. Guardian Caps have also been introduced in practices to lower the risk of impact injuries.</p>

        <h3>Total Snaps Missed by Location</h3>
        <iframe title="Total snaps missed by location" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-eQTZf" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/eQTZf/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="491"></iframe>
        <script>
          window.addEventListener("message", function(e) {
            if(e.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
              document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-eQTZf").style.height = e.data["datawrapper-height"].eQTZf + "px";
            }
          });
        </script>

        <p>At the youth level, solutions are harder to implement. Many schools lack funding for protective gear or on-site medical staff. Coaches and parents may not fully understand concussion symptoms or the importance of proper recovery. Football culture has traditionally prized toughness and playing through pain, making athletes hesitant to report injuries.</p>

        <p><em>"It's pretty well known that returning the kickoff is a really dangerous part of the game where a lot of concussions are sustained."</em></p>

        <p>Education has become an important part of prevention. Programs aimed at informing athletes, coaches, and parents about concussion risks and symptoms have been established, and state laws requiring return-to-play protocols are now common. But enforcement still varies widely.</p>

        <p>Policy changes, equipment improvements, and cultural shifts are all needed. Athletes must feel safe reporting symptoms, and coaches must prioritize player health over winning. Some progress is already visible, including public discussions by high-profile NFL players and new non-contact football leagues for younger players.</p>

        <p>Still, challenges remain. Underreporting is common, even in the NFL. At the youth and high school levels, where medical oversight is inconsistent, the problem is even greater. The data from 2012 to 2014 likely underestimates the true scope of the issue.</p>

        <p>Research into brain injuries continues to advance, offering hope for better diagnostics and treatment. Ongoing collaboration between medical experts, sports organizations, schools, and families will be essential to make football safer for future generations.</p>

        <p><em>"As players become more aware and education improves, the goal is to see fewer snaps lost to preventable concussions."</em></p>
