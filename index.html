          <h1>About Ryan Storie</h1>

          <p>I'm a freshman at the Newhouse School of Syracuse University. I am majoring in Broadcast and Digital Journalism. I'm originally from Cicero, N.Y., which is roughly 20 minutes away from Syracuse University. I went to high school locally at Christian Brothers Academy
        
            <p>I have plenty of experience in sports media. I currently work for Syracuse.com as a high school sports reporter. I also co-host a radio show for ESPN Syracuse. I did play-by-play commentary for the Auburn Doubledays baseball team.</p>
            <p>I am hoping to make a career for myself in sports broadcasting, specifically play-by-play broadcasting. However, I am willing to diversify my path through sports media. I also enjoy doing radio and writing about sports.</p>
